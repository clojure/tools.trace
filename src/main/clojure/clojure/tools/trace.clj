;;
;;  CHANGE LOG
;;
;;  March 4, 2012: Luc Préfontaine
;;
;;  * added macro wrappers around fns allowing dynamic tracing.
;;
;;  Feb. 20, 2012: Luc Préfontaine
;;
;;  * added contribution from Michał Marczyk and Don jackson to allow dynamic tracing of fns in a namespace.
;;
;;  Sept 18, 2011: Luc Préfontaine
;;
;;  * moved it to new contrib modular struct
;;
;;  * made it 1.2/1.3 compliant
;;
;;  * supported doc strings
;;
;;  * added a trace-form macro, from Jonathan Fischer
;; 
;;  December 3, 2008:
;; 
;;  * replaced *trace-out* with tracer
;; 
;;  * made trace a function instead of a macro
;;  (suggestion from Stuart Halloway)
;; 
;;  * added trace-fn-call
;; 
;;  June 9, 2008: first version
